                This website demonstrates some basic JavaScript concepts and React programming
                (forms, components, hooks for fetching APIs). It also includes some games like
                TicTacToe.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have intentionally not used any CSS frameworks like Bootstrap here, for although that
                would make the design of the site much easier and more efficient, I wanted to keep
                everything simple while demonstrating some basic CSS for images and nav bars.  Also,
                I have kept the color scheme bright and vivid.  This is not necessarily what I would do
                on a real site, but I wanted to focus more on the actual React content and less on the UI
                design, which I find tends to be handled by a UI developer anyway.
